# PROJECT MANAGER

This repo contains code that lets users sign up, login and create products which are then saved to a Mongo DB database and synced with a Firestore Database.

Users can also make comments on Products and reply to other comments. When a user gets a reply to their comment(s), they receive an email notification.

To easily test this, comments have been created by the user with the email "tradedepotinterview@mailinator.com".

Create a new User, get your login credentials and then reply to any of the aforementioned users's comments and then you can easily view emails received at this address by visiting https://www.mailinator.com and entering that email in the "search" bar.

Endpoints have been provided to create and view Users, Products and Comments.
These endpoints are documented in the Postman collection [here](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/938521/TWDZJGat).
